# Bit Checker Projects – RISC-V Assembly & SystemVerilog

This repository contains two implementations of a **10-bit binary bit checker**, written in:

- ✅ **RISC-V Assembly** (tested using [Venus RISC-V Simulator](https://venus.cs61c.org/))
- ✅ **SystemVerilog** (simulated on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/))

Both implementations were created for educational purposes.
